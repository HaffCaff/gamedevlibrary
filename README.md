Hey guys, so I was bored and decided to throw together a basic concept of what I thought John's idea could like like,
and this is what I came up with, its very basic and intutitive but its basic and I figured I wouldnt add anymore unless we
actually decide to use this...so yeah.


TO DO:
-Switch from built in array to MySQL database for game management
-Add export to CSV Functionality
-Clean up UI
-Add Filter Function
